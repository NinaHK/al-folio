I am assistant professor at the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences, University of Trento (Italy. My research is situated at the junction of computational semantics, cognitive science and AI. I lead the Computational Approaches to Language and Meaning CALM group, focusing on investigating the link between language and worlds (the real world and others). I am particularly interested in models of semantics that bridge across formal and distributional representations of meaning. Generally speaking, I have a predilection for phenomena which still resist simple formalisation, and have therefore always been attracted to genericity and odd quantificational phenomena. I have also worked on language and vision models of quantification. You can check out my publication list here. Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page]/al-folio/publications/) automatically. Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them."
